This version of img2terms is just some modification upon the img2terms from tsoding. (https://github.com/tsoding/img2term)

The only difference is that this img2terms uses multi thread to generate the pixels that are about to print to the console. 

But don't expect this img2terms is a lot faster than tsoding's version, it is the printing to console part taking a lot of time but not the actual computing part.
